### About Spacetogram! <a name="spacetogram"></a>
Spacetogram was made with [NASA's APOD API](link), [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) and [Animate.css](https://animate.style/).
It has the following features:
1. Fetches data from NASAâ€™s APOD API and displays the resulting images and descriptive data (title, date, description).
2. Infinite scrolling (until no more data can be fetched).
3. Like button that likes/undoes like image, with animated heart.

__Notes:__
* The API key used is DEMO_KEY, which NASA APIs limits to 30 requests per IP address per hour.
* The website currently does not display video APODs, only images.
* Trying to access the webapp via Github's sidebar (Environments>View Deployment link) may result in a [404](file:///C:/Users/susan/Documents/GitHub/Shopify_Intern_Applications/404.html), since Github Pages does not allow subfolders as a publishing source- please use this [link](https://nitephoenix.github.io/Shopify_Intern_Applications/Spacetagram/).
